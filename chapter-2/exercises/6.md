# Exercise 6
Why is it not a good idea for an identifier to contain more than one adjacent underscore (as in `current___balance`, for example)?

# Solution
Adding more than one adjacent underscore in an identifier does not improve readability more than a single underscore would. It also unnecessarily increases the identifier's length, potentially causing identifier ambiguity if it reaches the compiler's limit for accepted characters in an identifier.
