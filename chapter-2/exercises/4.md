# Exercise 4
Write a program that declares several `int` and `float` variables—without initializing them—and then prints their values. Is there any pattern to the values? (Usually there isn't.)

# Solution
Using the flags `-O -Wall -W -pedantic -ansi -std=c99` with the GCC compiler produces a program which prints 0 as the value for uninitialized `int`s and `float`s.
