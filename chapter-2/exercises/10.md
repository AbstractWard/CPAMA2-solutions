# Exercise 10
In the dweight.c program, which spaces are essential?

# Solution
```c
/*Computes the dimensional weight of a 12" x 10" x 8" box*/#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){int height,length,width,volume,weight;height=8;length=12;width=10;volume=height*length*width;weight=(volume+165)/166;printf("Dimensions: %dx%dx%d\n",length,width,height);printf("Volume (cubic inches): %d\n",volume);printf("Dimensional weight (pounds): %d\n",weight);return 0;}
```

The only essential spaces in the dweight.c program is the space between the `#include` directive and the `main` function, the spaces between types and identifiers, the space between the `return` statement and the `0` constant.

If readability in the output counts, then the spaces in the string literal are also essential.

If readability in the comments counts, then the spaces in the comments are also essential
