# Exercise 2

Consider the following program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill the time\n");
    printf("available for its completion.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

(a) Identify the directives and statements in this program.  
(b) What does the program produce?

# Solution

(a)
```c
#include <stdio.h> // Directive

int main(void)
{
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to "); // Statement
    printf("fill the time\n"); // Statement
    printf("available for its completion.\n"); // Statement
    return 0; // Statement
}
```

(b)  
The program produces the following output:
```
Parkinson's Law:
Work exands so as to fill the time
available for its completion.
```
