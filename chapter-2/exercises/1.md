# Exercise 1

Create and run Kernighan and Ritchie's famous "hello, world" program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

Do you get a warning message from the compiler? If so, what's needed to make it go away?

# Solution

A warning message is produced by the compiler when attempting to compile C89 compliant C code. Adding the statement `return 0;` at the end of the main function makes the warning go away.
