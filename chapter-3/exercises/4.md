# Exercise 4

Suppose that we call `scanf` as follows:  

```c
scanf("%d%f%d", &i, &x, &j);
```

If the user enters

```c
10.3 5 6
```

what will be the values of `i`
, `x`, and `j` after the call? (Assume that `i` and `j` are `int` variables and `x` is a `float` variable.)

# Solution

After the call to `scanf`, `i` will be `10`, `x` will be `0.3`, and `j` will be `5`. The `6` will remain in the buffer for the next `scanf` call.
