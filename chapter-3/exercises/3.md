# Exercise 3

For each of the following pairs of `scanf` format strings, indicate whether or not the two strings are equivalent. If they're not, show how they can be distinguished.

(a) `"%d"`              versus  `" %d"`  
(b) `"%d-%d-%d"`  versus  `"%d -%d -%d"`  
(c) `"%f"`               versus  `"%f "`  
(d) `"%f,%f"`        versus  `"%f, %f"`

# Solution
(a) Equivalent.  
(b) Not equivalent; spaces can be inserted before the `-` in the latter string, whereas spaces cannot be inserted before the `-` in the former string. Example: `1 -2 -3` will be accepted by the latter string as `1`, `2`, and `3`, whereas the former will refuse to read input beyond `1`.  
(c) Not equivalent; the latter string will continue reading whitespace characters after reading a `float` until a non-whitespace character is entered.  
(d) Equivalent.
