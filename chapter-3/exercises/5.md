# Exercise 5

Suppose that we call `scanf` as follows:

```c
scanf("%f%d%f", &x, &i, &y);
```

If the user enters

```c
12.3 45.6 789
```

what will be the values of `x`, `i`, and `y` after the call? (Assume `x` and `y` are `float` variables and `i` is an `int` variable.)

# Solution

After the call to `scanf`, `x` will be `12.3`, `i` will be `45`, and `y` will be `0.6`. `789` will be left in the buffer for the next `scanf` call.
